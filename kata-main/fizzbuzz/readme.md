## FizzBuzz

Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".

### Game Logic
Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and the players then count upwards in turn. 
However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word **fizz** and any number divisible by five by the word **buzz**. 
Numbers divisible by 15 become **fizzbuzz**. 
A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.

### Definition

Implement the logic for the fizzbuzz inside an idempotent function, and a wrapper who'll run the test from 1 to N.
